Hello!

I'm a french developper/craftsman ðŸ’» with years of field experience, currently CTO at [Zenika](https://www.zenika.com/) Paris. I organize, with others, the [Best of Web](bestofweb.paris/) french conference.

As a citizen of the world I'm interested in the ecological impact of the digital world and try to do wat I can on this matter ðŸŒ±

I have a [personnal website](http://raphael-lemaire.com/) here.
